# Day 0
Finally starting this script, for now i only create the Main and a side class that have the funcions to get the user input's, it show's a message to the user and then get the input typed by the user, if i want that get this input like a String i use one function but if i want that the input to be a int i use the second function that only will accept integer numbers between a pre seted range.

# Day 1
Added the first 4 options to edit a text, now the text can be edited to change all letter to upper case, or all letter to lower case and it can change the start of all phrases in on text to start with a upper case letter and for the last option it can capitalize the text, making all first letter go to upper case. In the next days i will think about other options to do with the text and maybe create search options too, like search for a certain word in a text, count how many times a word appear in the text and things like that.
