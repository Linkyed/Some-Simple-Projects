# Day 0
Finally starting this script, for now i only create the Main and a side class that have the funcions to get the user input's, it show's a message to the user and then get the input typed by the user, if i want that get this input like a String i use one function but if i want that the input to be a int i use the second function that only will accept integer numbers between a pre seted range.
