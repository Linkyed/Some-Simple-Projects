# Text Management

## Day 0
Finally starting this script, for now i only create the Main and a side class that have the funcions to get the user input's, it show's a message to the user and then get the input typed by the user, if i want that get this input like a String i use one function but if i want that the input to be a int i use the second function that only will accept integer numbers between a pre seted range.

## Day 1
Added the first 4 options to edit a text, now the text can be edited to change all letter to upper case, or all letter to lower case and it can change the start of all phrases in on text to start with a upper case letter and for the last option it can capitalize the text, making all first letter go to upper case. In the next days i will think about other options to do with the text and maybe create search options too, like search for a certain word in a text, count how many times a word appear in the text and things like that.

## Day 2
Today i added the search system to the script, now the user can type a word or a part of one and then the script will search for all the words to find when the choosed word appear and how many times it appear. And after that i created a way to the user to insert a string, loading a .txt file, now if the user has a .txt file with a text in, he can copy the path of the file and send to the script that might read the file and do all the editions/searching that it also do with a typed text in the own script

## Day 3
Now the after the user edition on the text, he can choose to save the text in a .txt file, he will need to choose the name of the file and the path where it will be saved. And i added some test's in the code to not get erros if the script can not find a file or can not create one.
